1. In general Messages are not shown properly anywhere.
2. Reporting is not done of any sort.
3. Do you want to Cook  ( Dinner, Lunch, Both)

5. There are still messages, English issues all over the place. 
6. Ability to export the weekly menu in a pdf , with pictures. This is very important for us for the social media.

####Basic error checks in the database and put message on Front end to show

#1. If no one is serving a location searched :  " We are trying hard to serve you in this location, will let you 
know once this location is launched:

2. If location has a chef but no one is serving today:  We are closed for the day for this location, sorry for the inconvenience.
3. If no one puts a menu : We are closed for the day, but you can pre-order lunch and dinner for the next 5 days
>>>>>(2,3): It is not done explicitly. Only 1 error is shown always.

Please have logo in between the white top header.  Have "Home, Blog, How it works" on left of the Menu  and "Be a HomeChef, Login "on the right of it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#####There is an issue the way you have coded the item location and display search
#####The filter for showing the dishes based on the distance from the chef should be on the landing page when 
#####the location is gathered, not in the CART. 
#####example : I was in Vasant Vihar today morning and its showing me all the chefs. I dont want a person to be 
####able to add item in the cart and then we are telling him that its too far.
